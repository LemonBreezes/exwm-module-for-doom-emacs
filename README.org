** Hacks

When switching to a workspace where an EXWM buffer is focused, inputs do not get
passed to the application. To fix this, I wrote a hook which clicks on the
application with the mouse to regain focus. The spot I chose for clicking may
not be blank for all applications. If someone finds a better solution, please
submit a pull request.

* Prerequisites

This module has no prerequisites.

* Features

+ Edit any application's input field with ~C-c '~

  usual with =C-x RET C-\=

  Firefox have extended support for Evil keybindings. Simply install the
